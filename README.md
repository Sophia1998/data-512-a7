## Purpose of this project

The coronavirus outbreak that began in February 2020 strikes a serious blow at the U.S. labor market and causes millions of Americans to leave the workforce. As it has a significant effect on the US economy, the unemployment during the pandemic has affected every Americanâ€™s life. Without stable income, many Americans can barely survive without enough food supplies and lack of rent. 
Besides the effects of the pandemic on employment, I also investigate how covid confirmed cases are affected by the mask mandates policy in Essex, MA.
